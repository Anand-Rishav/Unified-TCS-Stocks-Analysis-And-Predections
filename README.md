## Project Overview

This repository provides a unified framework for:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on TCS stock price data.
- **Data preprocessing** to ensure clean, usable datasets.
- **Feature engineering** to improve model performance.
- **Predictive modeling** using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.
- **Visualization** of trends, model results, and key insights.

All analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring an interactive, easy-to-follow experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anand-Rishav/Unified-TCS-Stocks-Analysis-And-Predections.git
cd Unified-TCS-Stocks-Analysis-And-Predections
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

- Ensure you have Python ≥3.7 and Jupyter installed.
- If a `requirements.txt` is present, install dependencies with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Open the Jupyter Notebook

- Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Open the `notebook.ipynb` file to explore the analysis.

## Usage

- Step through the notebook cells to review the data analysis process.
- Modify input parameters or try alternative models as desired.
- Use the provided code to analyze other similar stock datasets.

---

## Data Sources

- The notebook typically uses public historical data for TCS stocks.
- Data loading and preprocessing steps are included in the first sections of the notebook.
- Check within the notebook for direct links or scripts to fetch the latest data.

## Analysis Workflow

While the exact content of the notebook is not directly accessible here, a typical workflow includes:
- **Data Loading:** Import historical price data for TCS.
- **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **EDA:** Generate plots and statistics to understand price behavior.
- **Feature Engineering:** Add technical indicators or time-based features.
- **Modeling:** Train regression or time-series models (e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM).
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance with appropriate metrics (MSE, MAE, R², etc.).
- **Visualization:** Present predictions versus true values and other insightful charts.
